# MIC (Inner-Circle)

This repository is the Linux-native development workspace for MIC / Inner-Circle.
The goal is to build a minimal, reproducible verification infrastructure using
containerized services that mirror production environments.

Early focus: infrastructure clarity, data provenance, and operational truth.
